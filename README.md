# Loan Application Approval Predictor

## Overview

The Loan Application Approval Predictor is a machine learning project designed to predict the approval status of loan applications. The project consists of two main components:
1. **Model Training**: Training a machine learning model to predict loan approvals using Jupyter Notebook.
2. **Model Deployment**: Deploying the trained model as a web application using Flask.

## Project Motivation

In today's world, financial institutions receive a high volume of loan applications daily. Manually processing these applications can be time-consuming and prone to errors. An automated loan application approval system can help:
- Speed up the decision-making process.
- Reduce human bias and errors.
- Improve customer satisfaction by providing quicker responses.
- Assist in making data-driven decisions for loan approvals.

This project aims to create a predictive model that helps financial institutions automate the loan approval process, enhancing efficiency and accuracy.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data for training the machine learning model.
- **Model Training**: Train a machine learning model to predict loan approvals based on historical data.
- **Web Interface**: A user-friendly web interface for submitting loan applications and receiving predictions.
- **API Endpoint**: Provide an API endpoint for integrating the prediction model with other applications.

## Tech Stack

- **Python**: Programming language used for model training and web development.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Environment for data analysis and model training.
- **Flask**: Web framework for deploying the model as a web application.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library for model building.
- **HTML/CSS**: Front-end for the web application.
